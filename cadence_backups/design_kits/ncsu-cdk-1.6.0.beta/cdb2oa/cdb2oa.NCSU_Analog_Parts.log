147 cells and 757 cellviews were translated from library 'NCSU_Analog_Parts' in 37.2s.
In addition:
2 cell level directories were copied to the OpenAccess library.


Message Summary:

WARNING (CDBOA-605): For cellview <path>/<name> the view type implied by the   
                     file name (<viewtype>) differs from the view type held in  
                     the database (<viewtype>). Creating a view of type         
                     <viewtype> in OpenAccess.
                     
                      Generated 12 times. The translator has encountered a CDBA 
                     cellview for which the view type stored in the cellview    
                     data file differs from the view type implied by the        
                     cellview file name. OpenAccess expects a cellview filename 
                     to reflect the stored view type. The translator identifies 
                     conflicting view type information and fixes it by changing 
                     the cellview filename to agree with its stored view type.
                      For example, a CDBA cellview with the stored view type    
                     maskLayout to be called symbol.cdb. This would be          
                     translated into an OpenAccess cellview of type maskLayout  
                     called layout.oa.
                      To prevent these warnings from being generated, modify    
                     your CDBA data to ensure that the view type implied by the 
                     filename matches the view type stored for the cellview. For
                     example, if the filename is sch.cdb, then the view type    
                     should be schematic.
