75 cells and 146 cellviews were translated from library 'basic' in 12.2s.

Message Summary:

ERROR   (CDBOA-602): Cellview <path>/<name> has an obsolete view type and will   
                     not be translated.
                     
                      Generated 2 times. The translator has encountered a       
                     cellview with a view type that is obsolete. It is likely   
                     that the cellview was generated in a release prior to IC   
                     4.4.6, and that the view type and the software used to     
                     generate it are no longer supported. Check the cellview in 
                     question and, if it is still required, use the Cadence     
                     approved migration process to bring it into the current    
                     release.

WARNING (CDBOA-641): One or more unplaced instances were found in the cellview 
                     <name>.
                     
                      Generated 10 times. Any instance on CDB with the placement
                     status "unplaced" is not visible on OpenAccess. To change  
                     the placement status, use the -resetplacestatus option with
                     the cdb2oa command.
