This file documents the steps used to convert the CDK from CDB to OA.
By Rhett Davis (rhett_davis@ncsu.edu) 7/12/2007

1)  Exported the NCSU_CDK CVS tree with the command:
      cvs export -D 2007-07-11 NCSU_CDK
    Once a workable version of the NCSU_CDKOA is available, a new repository
    will be created (so as not to conflict with the CDB files in the current
    repository).

2)  Added Virtuoso 6.1.1 to the environment.

3)  Created the directory cdb2oa to run the conversion programs and archive
    the results.  Set the CDK_DIR environment variable to the installation
    directory and Copied the $CDK_DIR/cdssetup/.cdsinit file into the
    cdb2oa directory.
    

4)  Ran cdb2oa on the basic library with the command

      cdb2oa -cdslibpath $CDK_DIR/cdssetup/cds.lib -lib basic >& cdb2oa.basic.log

    Also ran cdb2oa on NCSU_Analog_Parts and NCSU_Digital_Parts.

5)  Deleted all files in the lib directory and moved the newly created basic,
    NCSU_Analog_Parts, and NCSU_Digital_Parts libraries into that directory.
    Modified the cdb2oa/cds.lib and lib.defs files accordingly.

6)  Made the following changes to cdssetup/cdsenv:

     - Commented out the lines beginning with cdsSpice, spectreS, and hspiceS.
       It appears that these tools are no longer supported, and these lines give
       the errors on startup like the following:
       "*WARNING* Cannot find /local/ic611/tools.lnx86/dfII/etc/tools/cdsSpice 
        directory to load environment variables"

     - Changed the line 'asimenv.startup   simulator  string  "hspiceS"'
       to "hspiceD".  It appears that hspiceD is supported, even though 
       hspiceS is not.

7)  Made the following changes to cdssetup/cdsinit:

     - Commented out the loading of skill/config_files/schConfig.il.  For some
       reason, got the following startup errors when loading this file:
       "*WARNING* (icLic-3) Could not get license Virtuoso_Schematic_Editor_L"
       Also spewed out about 300 lines of code from that file in the CIW.
       Very annoying.  This is not a fix, but a measure to set aside the
       errors for the moment.

     - Commented out the lines that call awvSetOptionValue.  Not sure what these
       lines are for, but they were causing the warning 
       "*WARNING* There were no system .cdsplotinit files found."

     - Commented out the lines with the command "asiSetEnvOptionVal".  These
       lines were referring to the tools spectreS and hspiceS, which no longer
       appear to be supported.  When changing these references to spectre and
       hspiceD (which do appear to be supported, got the error
       "*Error* asiEnvGetVar: Variable `envOpts modelPath' not declared for 
        tool `spectre'"

8)  Modified the file skill/menus/ciw/createLib.il, procdedure 
    compileAllTechLibs(), to call compileTechLib() rather than 
    createRuleViaLib().  (Also commented out the calls to ddDeleteObj in this
    procedure, since the templib is never created and can't be deleted).
    The createRuleViaLib() isn't working, because
    LEF & DEF import and export appears to need some changes to the techfile.
    This means that ruleVias will not be created, and LEF/DEF import/export
    will not be supported until this is fixed.


9)  Started Virtuoso with the command "virtuoso -log CDS.log.compileTech &"
    Executed the command compileAllTechLibs() and exited.  There were a number
    of errors that are captured in the log file.

10) Moved the new libraries to the lib/ directory.

11) Commented out the library MOSIS_Layout_Test from the cdssetup/cds.lib
    file.  We'll get around to this later.  Also created the file
    cdssetup/lib.defs file.

12) Modified the skill/menus/triggers.il file as follows.  These changes
    were necessary to make P-Cells work.  Many thanks to Matthew Guthaus
    at UC Santa Cruz for finding this fix on 10/1/2006.

     - added the following code to the NCSU_LayoutAppTrigger() procedure:
            if( (not (boundp 'bag)) then
            printf("Getting layout propert bag")
            GetPropBag()
            )
 
     - Created the procedure NCSU_LayoutAppTrigger():
         procedure( NCSU_SchematicAppTrigger( args )
            if( (not (boundp 'bag)) then
              printf("Getting schematic propert bag")
              GetPropBag()
            )
         )

     - Registered the new schematic trigger:

           deRegUserTriggers( "schematic"  'NCSU_SchematicAppTrigger
                                           'NCSU_MenuTrigger )

13) Commented out the following lines from skill/cdf/fet_cdf.il, because
    they kept giving "propset" errors.  Many thanks again to Matthew Guthaus
    at UC Santa Cruz for finding this fix on 10/1/2006.

	cdfgData->dleUseCell->value = strcat( TechLib " " Cell )
	cdfgData->lxUseCell->value = strcat( TechLib " " Cell )


14) Ran the script "linkem" to create symbolic links.  This script is
    not distributed with CDK, but can be found in the directory
    /afs/bp.ncsu.edu/dist/cadence_cdk/devel/linkem at NCSU.  The script
    had to be modified to remove references to the MOSIS_Layout_Test
    library, since this hasn't been converted, yet.

15) Modified the README and NCSU_CDK_Version files.  Tar'ed and gz'ed the
    archived for distribution.
