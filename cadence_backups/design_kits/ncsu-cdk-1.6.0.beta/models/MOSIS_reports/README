The XL parameter has been modified as follows (to account for drawn vs.
manufactured gate length changes -- thinox devices only):

AMI 0.5um (SCN_SUBM): XL = 0.0
AMI 1.6um (SCN): XL = 0.0
HP 0.35um (SCN4M_SUBM): XL = -0.05
HP 0.5um (SCN3M_SUBM): XL = -0.10
TSMC 0.18um: Not available
TSMC 0.25um (SCN5M_SUBM): XL = -0.03
TSMC 0.35um (SCN4M_SUBM): XL = -0.02
